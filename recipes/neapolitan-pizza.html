    <p>
      This Neapolitan pizza dough recipe makes two 12-inch pizzas. Apply your
      sauce, cheese, toppings, and a final spread of cheese to tie it all
      together.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>3 cups Caputo pizza flour, or as needed</li>
      <li>1 ¼ teaspoons salt</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon fast-rising dry yeast</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups ice water, or as needed</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon granulated garlic</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Italian seasoning</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, mix flour, salt, and yeast until thoroughly combined.
        Mix in ice water, scraping the bowl as you mix, until all flour and
        water have been incorporated into a soft dough. Mix in 2 tablespoons of
        olive oil. Turn dough out onto a floured work surface, and knead until
        dough is firm but slightly sticky, mixing in more flour if needed. Knead
        granulated garlic and Italian seasoning into dough. (The kneading step
        can be done in a bread machine set on the Dough setting.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Form dough into a round, and place into an oiled bowl. Brush the top
        with 1/2 teaspoon of olive oil, cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and
        allow dough to rise until double, 1 to 2 hours. Punch down dough, and
        cut in half. Form each half into a 12-inch pizza crust, and place on
        pizza pans.
      </li>
      <li>
        Move a rack to the bottom position in oven, and preheat the oven to 450
        degrees F (230 degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake pizza crusts on the bottom rack just until firm, 3 to 7 minutes.
        Allow crusts to cool for about 10 minutes before topping with sauce,
        cheese, or other desired ingredients and returning to the oven to bake.
      </li>
